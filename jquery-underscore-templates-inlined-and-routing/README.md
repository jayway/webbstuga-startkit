# jQuery templates inlined with routing

**This exercise builds on
[the jQuery templates inlined exercise](../jquery-templates-inlined).**

Templates are inlined in `index.html`. Edit `main.js` to get started.


This exercise adds routing, using [director.js](https://github.com/flatiron/director) and is actually more of an example than a exercise.

Copy and paste your code from the previous exercises to fit into the structure of this example. **And make sure understand why using links (and routing) is a good way to deal with state in web apps**
