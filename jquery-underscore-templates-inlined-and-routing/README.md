# jQuery templates inlined with routing

**This exercise builds on
[the jQuery templates inlined exercise](../jquery-templates-inlined).**

Templates are inlined in `index.html`. Edit `main.js` to get started.


This exercise adds routing, using [director.js](https://github.com/flatiron/director) and is actually more of an example.

Copy and paste your code from the previous exercises to fit into the structure of this example.
