# jQuery templates inlined with routing

This exercise (or example really) introduces the concept of _Routing_ to
handle application state in a Javascript web application. Go ahead and read the
full post on Stack Overflow linked below.

> Routing is a way of organizing and managing application states. A routing
> framework in JavaScript helps you to change the state of the
> application--perhaps moving from one admin panel section to another--while
> maintaining application persistence.

## Description

**This exercise builds on
[the jQuery templates inlined exercise](../jquery-templates-inlined).**

Templates are inlined in `index.html`. Edit `main.js` to get started.

Copy and paste your code from the previous exercises to fit into the structure
of this example. **And make sure understand why using links (and routing) is a
good way to deal with state in web apps**
