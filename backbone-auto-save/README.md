# Backbone "auto save"

The intent of this exercise is to look at auto saving a form. It is based on the "Backbone on change" exercise.

_This exercise is not supposed to actually save anything._

## The Exercise

1.  When the user changes the name, instead of just chaning the view header, do a POST (which will fail, but that is not the point).
2.  Think about the performance consequences for saving on each keystroke. Then, look at underscore.js' functions [debounce](http://underscorejs.org/#debounce) and [throttle](http://underscorejs.org/#throttle). Which one of them do you think is the most fitting for your needs.
3.  Now, implement auto save for all the form fields.

## Next Exercise

To be continued in Part 3 (TBD)!
