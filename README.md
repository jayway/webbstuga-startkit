# Webbstuga Startkit

Welcome to the Webbstuga Startkit! We're happy that you want to learn more about web development :)

The three big web technologies are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. One way to think of them is that HTML is the content, CSS is the styling and JavaScript is dynamic behavior (traditionally).

There are two entry points in this course. The first one is to learn more about HTML and CSS, using external sources (linked below). The other one is to learn more about the history of JavaScript. You can also iterate between these two entry points, if you want to.

When you have completed the JavaScript labs and feel confident in HTML and CSS, pick a modern JS framework and find a tutorial or two on that. Or why not experiment with server-side rendering? The possibilities are endless... :)

## HTML + CSS

Here is a small collection of external sources to learn more about HTML and CSS.

## JavaScript

We at Jayway think it's important to know some history on JavaScript development, since many frameworks/libraries are solution to past problems. We want to know more about the history to see if we actually have these problems that the solutions solve (otherwise, we have waste). Also, we don't want to repeat anti-patterns from history, like having a big [Single-Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPA) without a single [hash route](http://cdnjs.com/libraries/backbone.js/tutorials/what-is-a-router). Some even say that developing a big SPA is an anti-pattern in itself. Our opinion of "SPA vs server-side web" is: it depends! It's better to know both sides of the coin.

### Preparation

Open your developer toolbar and click the settings wheel on the left. Make sure
that the checkbox "Disable cache (while DevTools is open)" is checked. It's the
first checkbox in the "General" tab.

### Topics

The different topics are divided into sub-directories in this repository. You
can work through them in any order you like, and skip those that you feel
comfortable with already. However, the order in which they are listed is a path
through the "Webbstuga" that we believe is reasonable.

### Features to implement in Javascript topics

These features are not applicable to all topics, but try to implement them
and see where it leads you.
