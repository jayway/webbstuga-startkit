# Webbstuga Startkit

## Preparation

Open your developer toolbar and click the settings wheel on the left. Make sure that the checkbox "Disable cache (while DevTools is open)" is checked. It's the first checkbox in the "General" tab.

## Topics

The different topics are divided into sub-directories in this repository. You can
work through them in any order you like, and skip those that you feel comfortable
with already. However, the order in which they are listed is a path through the
"Webbstuga" that we believe is reasonable.
