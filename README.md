# Webbstuga Startkit

## Preparation

Open your developer toolbar and click the settings wheel on the left. Make sure
that the checkbox "Disable cache (while DevTools is open)" is checked. It's the
first checkbox in the "General" tab.

## Topics

The different topics are divided into sub-directories in this repository. You
can work through them in any order you like, and skip those that you feel
comfortable with already. However, the order in which they are listed is a path
through the "Webbstuga" that we believe is reasonable.
