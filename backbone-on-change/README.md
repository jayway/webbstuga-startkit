# Backbone "on change"

The intent of this exercise is to look at reacting to user input. It is based on the "Backbone" exercise.

_This exercise is not supposed to actually save anything._

## The Exercise

1.  Add an item header on the "Edit item" view, if not already there. The header should be the item's name
2.  When the text field for the item's name changes, the header should immediately be updated with the correct name.

## Next Exercise

[`backbone-auto-save`](backbone-auto-save)
