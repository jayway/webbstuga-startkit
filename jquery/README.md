# jQuery

* Open `index.html` in Chrome
* Your Javascript code should be located in `main.js` (this file is imported in
  index.html)
* You should open the Developer Console in Chrome the first thing you do.
* You should replace the inner content of the `div` with the class container with
  "your stuff".

Try to list the items, indicating in some way (true/false is ok) if they are completed or not.
When that is done, ask yourself: "what would be the implications of using only jQuery for a JS client?"

In [the next exercise](../jquery-underscore-templates-inlined) you'll learn a better technique for generating strings to insert in the DOM.
