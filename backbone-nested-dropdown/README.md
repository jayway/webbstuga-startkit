# Backbone Nested Dropdown

The purpose of this exercise is to get some experience with a common problem, namely nested dropdowns.

## The Exercise

When adding an item in this app you should be able to pick a _context and sub-context_.

A nested dropdown is sometimes called a "cascading dropdown" and you can see an example of one here: [http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/dropdownlist/cascadingdropdownlist](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/dropdownlist/cascadingdropdownlist)

_This exercise is not supposed to actually save anything, the view Javascript and form rendering is the focus._

### When creating a new item

1.  Render a dropdwon based on the contents of api/contexts/index.json
2.  Based on what the user chooses in the first dropdown, render the second dropdown accordingly

### When editing an existing item

1.  Render the correct dropdowns depending on the contents of api/1.json
