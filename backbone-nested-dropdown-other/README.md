# Backbone Nested Dropdown with "other" field

This builds on the Backbone Nested Dropdown exercise, adding a text field to the nested dropdown solution.

_This exercise is not supposed to actually save anything, the view Javascript and form rendering is the focus._

## The Exercise

1.  For your nested dropdowns, create a last option "Other" in the first dropdown
2.  When the "Other" option is chosen the user should be able to enter text in a custom text field (which substitutes the second dropdown
