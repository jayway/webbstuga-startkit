Backbone (simple views)
==================

NB! You need to run this in chrome/chromium with --disable-web-security, like this
  chromium --disable-web-security
Chrome/chroimium can't already be opened when you run this command.

Here, we a small fraction of backbone's functionality. Basically, we use it for having a common convention for what a view "is", plus binding 'this' to make it be more understandable.

In this exercise, we have started to refactor showItemListView.js in views/ and your tasks are 
  - fix the TODO in showItemListView.js
  - finish the refactoring, i.e. refactor showItemView.js and main.js

## Next Exercise
